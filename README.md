Incognito Google
===========

A Chrome extension to open Google searches in an incognito window.
=======
# Incognito-Google
Open Google search results in an incognito window to protect privacy on links you click

Always open google searches from google.com or from the address bar in an Incognito window.  You will be visiting unknown sites from the google search results page.  Avoid tracking by these sites using an Incognito window.

This is the fastest, simplest, and easiest to use incognito extension.  Others require you to do something special to launch an incognito tab or search incognito.  With this one, just do your search as usual and the results open in an incognito window.  Easy.
